I'm a senior software engineer at Google who's been a core [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/) dev since 2010.

I've been [tech lead](https://www.patkua.com/blog/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/) for Bazel's [configurability effort](https://bazel.build/roadmaps/configuration.html) since 2016. I wrote [this summary](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/02/11/configurable-builds-part-1.html) in 2019.

I believe Bazel can elevate software creation on a scale similiar to [automated testing](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html?ref=hackernoon.com#TheImportanceOftestAutomation), [continuous integration](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html), and [social coding](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/culture/practice_social_coding/), particularly because of its strength in [reproducible builds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds). It's a clear leader in a new generation of build tools.

I value design simplicity, clear communication, [automated pipelines](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/01/19/fulfilling-the-promise-of-ci-cd/), respectful collaboration, and rich IDEs. I'm indebted to many for helping me form these values.

I gave a highly regarded [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVx59XOZtSA) on the history of [111 Eighth Ave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/111_Eighth_Avenue) in 2016 based on extensive primary research.
